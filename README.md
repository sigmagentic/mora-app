# 🔐 Mora App

**Mora exists to capture human values the world cannot see — without ever revealing the people behind them.**

AI already owns almost all human data — behavior, language, preferences, and soon, even synthetic reasoning.

But there is one dataset AI cannot access at scale:
authentic human moral judgment.

When moral decisions are public, people self-censor.
When they’re logged, people lie.
When they’re permanent, people perform.

We are building a zero-knowledge system that captures how humans actually resolve moral dilemmas, without revealing who they are or what they chose.

This creates a new class of data:
- Non-synthetic
- Non-performative
- Non-attributable
- Verifiably aggregated

We believe this “moral signal” will become one of the most valuable datasets for AI alignment, safety, and reasoning — precisely because it cannot be extracted any other way.
